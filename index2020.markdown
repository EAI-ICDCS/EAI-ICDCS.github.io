<h2>Efficient Artificial Intelligence For Edge Computing </h2>
<h2>ICDCS 2020 Workshop</h2>
</div>

## Topic Description

This workshop focuses on an emerging and impactful topic  Efficient Artificial Intelligence (EAI), that facilitate the edge computing by fitting AI models into the edge-AI device. Deep learning has achieved wide success in applications including image classification, video analytics, audio processing thanks to the rapid development of machine learning frameworks (Tensorflow, Pytorch, Caffe) and the accessibility of high-end GPUs. However, requirements in data privacy, communication bandwidth, and processing latency are driving AI to the edge.  Edge AI devices operate with tight resource budgets such as memory, power and computing horsepower. AI technology with high-end GPUs for training and running large neural networks are not suitable for edge AI.

The main principles of efficient AI for edge computing are efficiency, effectiveness, and adaptability. Efficiency is the ability to achieve the required performance with constrained resources (e.g. compute, memory, storage, and power). Effectiveness is the ability to achieve a good quality of results (QoR) with efficiency taken into consideration. Adaptability deals with the ability to adapt to changing needs, environment, and operational conditions. Together, these three principles of efficient AI formulate the key metrics toward ultra-efficient AI for edge devices. In the last few years, we have witnessed a growing research trend in these principles.  Various kinds of techniques are proposed such as post-training or training-aware quantization and pruning, hardware-software co-design, low power machine learning, etc. The research and development progress has been complemented in popular machine learning frameworks with many applications in image classification, video analysis, IoTs, circuit/chip design, health monitoring and more.

## Workshop Format and Schedule

The EAI workshop will feature full-day events. We plan to invite 2 to 4 keynote speakers who are leading experts from both academia and industry. A list of keynote speakers includes:

+ **Shangjiang Tang**, Associate Professor from Tianjin University (Confirmed).
+ **Yao Chen**, Research Scientist from Advanced Digital Sciences Center UIUC (Confirmed).
+ **Zeng Zeng**, Senior Scientist from I2R, A\*STAR (Confirmed).

We will also organize a panel by the invited speakers to discuss EAI challenges & opportunities.

### **Submission Information**
All papers need to be submitted electronically in PDF format through [**<u>here</u>**](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eai2020) hosted with EasyChair. Papers must be formatted for 8.5x11-inch paper. The length of the paper must be no more than 6 pages (or 8 pages with over-length charge) in the IEEE double-column format (10-pt font), including references and everything. The reviews will be single blind. At least one of the authors of every accepted paper must register and present the paper at the workshop.

### **Important Dates**
~~**Submission Deadline**: March 20, 2020~~  
~~**Extended Submission Deadline**: March 27, 2020~~  
~~**Acceptance Notifications**: April 3, 2020~~  
~~**Acceptance Notifications**: April 7, 2020~~  
~~**Camera-ready**: April 17, 2020~~

All submissions will be considered for oral and poster presentations at EAI. The decision on presentation format will be based primarily on an assessment of the breadth of interest, and the construction. We will seek sponsorship to set up the best paper and best poster awards.

A tentative workshop schedule is outlined below:
